## note<3

To play the Wordle game (both text version and pygame version), please don't forget to download the project file along with the file that contains the words named 'allowed.txt' and 'ans.txt'. Also, if you're planning to play the Wordle game using pygame, please download the project files named 'other.py' and 'settings.py'
(put all of these files in the same folder and open them in python to make it work :))

ありがとう, Danke, 谢谢!!
